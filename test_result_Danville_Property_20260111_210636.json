Using $850/sqft as a neighborhood benchmark for well-finished single-family stock, Greenbrook at an estimated $754/sqft is characterized as slightly below that micro-market average, though still above the broader city median.\",\n    \"rent_and_yield_assumptions\": \"High-demand Danville family homes in good school districts typically rent at roughly 0.30\u20130.40% of market value per month.

Using a $2.4M purchase price and a cap-excluded net operating margin of ~4.25\u20134.5% of gross rent after taxes, insurance, maintenance, and reserves gives an approximate cap rate of ~3.4%.

With some interest and depreciation tax benefits, long-term principal paydown, and modest rent growth, this can approximate a 4\u20136% effective cash-on-cash return for a well-capitalized investor; this analysis sets a midpoint of 5% as a reasonable pro forma expectation rather than a guaranteed outcome.\",\n    \"operating_costs_detail\": \"Annual insurance is estimated at about $2,500, consistent with premiums for well-maintained suburban Contra Costa County single-family homes of this value, outside of extreme fire-risk zones.

Looking forward five years, continued structural demand, constrained inventory, and regional job growth argue for a generally bullish outlook, moderated by interest-rate risk and broader macro conditions.
